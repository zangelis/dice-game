# Dice Game

To deepen my knowledge about DOM and JS I created my own dice game.

## How to play
When refreshing the page (Windows: `F5` / Mac: `Command + R`), the dice are thrown randomly. The website will display the winner based on whose value was higher.

## Installation & Usage
To check out my code, just clone the repository like this:
```
https://github.com/zangelis/dice-game.git
cd dice-game
```
If you want to view the page in the browser, copy the path from dicee.html and paste it into the search bar.
